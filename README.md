["Build Your Own Shell" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/shell/overview).

In this challenge, I have build my own POSIX compliant shell that's capable of
interpreting shell commands, running external programs and builtin commands like
cd, pwd, echo and more.

1. Ensure you have `cmake` installed locally
2. Run `./your_shell.sh` to run your program, which is implemented in
   `src/main.cpp`.
